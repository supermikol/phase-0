<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I thought it was pretty fun to see the results translate immediately on the page. It's definitely much more straightforward than typical programming.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Wasn't much researching to do (with the exception of looking up hr) because David has had some experience in HTML and was helpful with code that made the page work.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We took advantage of header tags to keep track of different size texts.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It's good in that the code is directly translatable into something we can see on the screen, making it easy to learn and apply. Less abstract concepts than Ruby, for sure.
The bad thing is that it can get tedious to type, since there is a code for literally every thing on the screen. There's no iteration, so the more sophisticated a site looks, the more sophisticated the code.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Keeping track of tags, and keeping the code semantically clean and easy to understand. For instance, I should be minimizing my use of <br>, as David explained.

//Pseudocode
1. Create a (sum) function that takes in an array of values as a parameter.
2. The function should contain a variable (container) set to 0.
3. Using a FOR loop, iterate through every element of the array, and add the value of each element to the empty variable.
4. Return the container variable (which should equal the sum of all the values in the array)
5. Create a second (median) function that also takes an array of values as parameter
6. The function should first sort the array.
7. Within the function: Set up a conditional statement, where if the length of the array is odd, return the value within the array at the index value equal to length of array divided by two (and rounded down. hint: floor).
8. Else (if the length of the array is odd), then return the value that is the average of the array value at the index [array length divided two] and [array length divided by two minus 1]. This should target the two values that are sitting in the middle of the array.
9.(Optional) Include a pony, without the monkey nonsense.

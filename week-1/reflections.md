#Think About Time
Between the videos and readings, I learned about the pomodoro technique, which is a form of Time Boxing, a work methodology whereby a pre-determined time limit is set to work on a specific task. This method of work sounds promising, as it will help users keep track of time, while setting specific time limits that will keep users focused during that period of time.

Currently, I my time management system is rather flexible. Over the years, I’ve learned to give myself rest when I need it, and to just focus on productivity whenever I’m free. The perks of being my own boss is that  I can take naps when I need to, and sleep/wake as my internal clock dictates. However, I do try to show up at the office every day to make sure everyone else is doing work they’re supposed to be doing.

My current strategy works well when I have a sense of urgency. Throw in a few cups of coffee and I can get things done at a rapid efficient pace. Things with longer-term rewards (like working out, and grinding research work for projects) are always tough, but I think I’ve got those things under control for the most part. I’ve learned to impose senses of urgencies on call as needed.

Depending on how DBC shapes out to be, I might just adopt this ‘time-box’ frame of work if it proves successful during implementation there.

#The Command Line
What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is a user interface for accessing a computer's basic functions. There are two main types of shells, a CLI (Command Line Interface), which is completely text based, and the more advanced GUI (Graphic User Interface) that is more accessible by new users. Bash is a CLI-type shell that is included in the Mac OS (itself a GUI shell)

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The examples and challenges are not the most inspiring, so it's essentially rote-learning facts and instructions. Not my forte.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
As many as the crash course introduced.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
I think it's critical to be able to traverse the directories first and foremost, so 'ls' and 'cd' are probably the most important, followed by 'rmdir', 'rm -r', 'mkdir', 'mv', which allows us to manipulate the directories in the system.
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
pwd: Print working directory
-ls: List all files in directory
-mv: Move (renames) files
-cd: change directory
-../: step back in directory
-touch: create a new file
-mkdir: make a new directory (folder)
-less: reads file
-rmdir: remove directory
-rm: remove file
-help: help

#Forking And Cloning
If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
To create a new repo on git is to simply initialize an existing directory into a git repo by typing in "git init" in CML.
To fork a repo is to take an existing repo and make a copy of it in your own directory. This is done on github by clicking on 'fork' and then selecting the appropriate user account you want to fork the repo into.
To clone a repo is to take an existing repo and clone it locally on your computer, usually done after you fork it to your profile. This can be accomplished in the command line by entering 'git clone' followed by the link to the .git file
Forking is beneficial in the sense that you get to work with an exact replicate of an existing program, as opposed to creating something from scratch.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
Hardest part is retaining all the various commands. It seems pretty intuitive to learn, but when it comes to reenacting a lot of the steps, it's a lot harder. Practice makes perfect.
